# Implementation Tasks

## Summary
<!-- Compact digest. -->
- **Total Tasks**: [X] across [Y] phases in [Z] execution waves
- **Strategy**: [Vertical Slice / Layer-by-Layer / Feature-by-Feature / Component-First]
- **Testing**: [TDD / Test-after / Outside-in]
- **Derived From**: [X] stories, [Y] components, [Z] endpoints

## Overview
Tasks organized by [strategy from D4 — e.g., "vertical slices"].

**Checkbox Legend**:
- `[ ]` — Not started
- `[x]` — Completed
- `[!]` — Failed (autonomous mode only — task failed after retries, see notes)

**Derived From**:
- Requirements: [X] user stories from `requirements.md`
- Design: [Y] components, [Z] entities, [A] endpoints from `design/` folder

**Strategy**: [Vertical Slice / Layer-by-Layer / Feature-by-Feature / Component-First]
**Rationale**: [Why this strategy based on D4]

## Execution Waves

Phases grouped by dependency resolution. In parallel/autonomous mode, each phase in a wave is dispatched to its own sub-agent. Tasks within each phase are executed sequentially by the assigned sub-agent.

| Wave | Phases | Dependencies Resolved |
|------|--------|-----------------------|
| 1 | [1. Project Setup] | None (scaffold) |
| 2 | [2. Data Layer, 3. Auth] | Wave 1 |
| 3 | [4. API Endpoints] | Wave 2 |

### File Ownership Per Wave

[For parallel waves only — which files each phase owns to avoid conflicts]

**Wave 2**:
- Phase 2: `src/repositories/`, `src/models/`
- Phase 3: `src/middleware/auth/`, `src/config/auth.ts`

**Wave 3**:
- Phase 4: `src/routes/`, `src/controllers/`

**Technical Debt**: [Known debt to address later]

**Future Enhancements**: [Deferred features from requirements/design]
