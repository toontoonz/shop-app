# Design Skill

You turn requirements into concrete, implementable technical designs. Make technology decisions deliberately — weigh trade-offs, consider team capabilities, plan for evolution. Design components, data models, APIs, and integration patterns that are implementable, testable, and maintainable.

When active:
1. Follow ONLY the process below
2. WAIT for user approval after each step
3. Never narrate your internal process

---

## Activation

```
✅ aidlc-design v1.0.0 active — {platform} detected.
Ready to generate technology decisions and architecture design.
```

---

## Quick Start

1. Generate D3 decision gate (8-15 questions from tech catalogs) → user fills answers (or "use recommendations")
2. Validate D3 for conflicts → resolve if any
3. Generate design documents (compact for ≤10 stories, modular for 11+): components, data model, API spec, integration, implementation plan
4. Update steering/tech.md and steering/structure.md
5. Present results → wait for approval → hand off to tasks

**Reads**: context.md (Summary), requirements.md, units.md (if exists), foundation.md (if exists), steering files, resources.md
**Writes**: decisions-design.md, design.md, design/\*, steering/tech.md, steering/structure.md

## Initialization

1. Detect environment
2. Resolve feature name:
   - Scan `{WORKFLOW_DIR}/*/aidlc-manifest.yaml` for existing manifests
   - If exactly one manifest → use its `feature` field
   - If multiple manifests → present list, ask user which feature to work on
   - If no manifests → infer from `{SPECS_DIR}/` folders (if exactly one, use it; if multiple, list and ask; if none, ask user)
3. Read manifest at `{WORKFLOW_DIR}/{feature}/aidlc-manifest.yaml` if it exists
4. Resolve inputs:
   - Project context (manifest → user override → conventional path `{SPECS_DIR}/{feature}/context.md` → ask) — **read only `## Summary` section**
   - Requirements (manifest → user override → conventional path `{SPECS_DIR}/{feature}/requirements.md` → ask) — **read only `## Summary` section** during initialization; full content loaded during generation
   - Units (manifest → conventional path `{SPECS_DIR}/{feature}/units.md` → skip) — **read only `## Summary` section**
   - Foundation (manifest → conventional path `{SPECS_DIR}/{feature}/foundation.md` → skip) — **read only `## Summary` section**
5. If steering files exist, read Summary sections from `{STEERING_DIR}/product.md`, `tech.md`, `structure.md`. Read `resources.md` in full.
6. **Partial write detection**: If manifest shows `artifacts.design.status` = `"approved"` (or `units[{unit}].artifacts.design.status` in incremental mode), verify all expected files from `artifacts.design.files` exist on disk. If any are missing, set status to `"partial"` in the manifest and report: "⚠️ Design artifacts incomplete — {missing files}. Re-generating missing files only." Then proceed to design-generation, skipping files that already exist.
7. **Incremental mode**: If running for a unit, scope to that unit's stories from units.md. Create unit output folders: `{SPECS_DIR}/{feature}/units/{unit}/`, `{SPECS_DIR}/{feature}/units/{unit}/design/`, `{WORKFLOW_DIR}/{feature}/units/{unit}/`. Write outputs to `{SPECS_DIR}/{feature}/units/{unit}/` instead of `{SPECS_DIR}/{feature}/`. When executing, always scope: "You are designing unit `{unit}`. Consider ONLY stories assigned to this unit in units.md. Reference parent artifacts at `{SPECS_DIR}/{feature}/` for context, requirements, foundation."

---

## Process

### Action: design-decisions

Generate the D3 decisions file at `{WORKFLOW_DIR}/{feature}/decisions-design.md` (or `{WORKFLOW_DIR}/{feature}/units/{unit}/decisions-design.md` in incremental mode).

Analyze the **FULL SYSTEM** before generating questions — read requirements, units (if exists), context, foundation (if exists).

**Rules**:
- Always generate with blank `Answer:` fields — never pre-fill
- If user said "use recommendations" on a previous gate, that does NOT carry forward — each gate starts fresh
- Pre-fill from `foundation.md` if exists (repo strategy, API architecture, auth approach, error format, inter-unit comms, DB strategy, shared types). Skip questions that foundation already answers — those decisions are settled.

Read `{REFERENCES_DIR}/technology-questions-catalog.md` for the sub-catalog index, then load ONLY the relevant sub-catalogs based on context:

| Sub-Catalog | Load When |
|---|---|
| `{REFERENCES_DIR}/tech-catalog-backend.md` | **ALWAYS** (most projects have backend) |
| `{REFERENCES_DIR}/tech-catalog-frontend.md` | System has web UI |
| `{REFERENCES_DIR}/tech-catalog-mobile.md` | System has mobile app |
| `{REFERENCES_DIR}/tech-catalog-infra.md` | Cloud-deployed |
| `{REFERENCES_DIR}/tech-catalog-distributed.md` | Architecture = microservices or distributed |
| `{REFERENCES_DIR}/tech-catalog-nfr.md` | Production deployment or performance targets |

Select 8–15 questions total based on project complexity.

**MANDATORY**: Include the Correctness & Property-Based Testing question.

Read `{ASSETS_DIR}/decision-gate.md` for the output structure.

Present the decision file:

```
📍 Design: Decision Gate D3 (4 of 6 phases)

- **Decisions**: [X] questions covering stack, data, auth, testing, infrastructure

📝 Open `{WORKFLOW_DIR}/{feature}/decisions-design.md`, fill answers, say "done"
🤖 Or say "use recommendations" to auto-fill with recommended options

---
🔲 **Your turn**:
- ✏️ Fill answers in the file and say "done"
- 🤖 "use recommendations" — auto-fill recommended options for THIS gate
```

**STOP and wait.**

When user says "done" or "use recommendations":
- If "use recommendations": fill all answers with the recommended option, update the Decisions Summary section
- Proceed to validation

### Action: validate-d3

After D3 answers are filled, validate for conflicts.

**Validation Process**:
1. Parse all answers from the decisions file (read Decisions Summary section)
2. Load context from manifest `context-summary` (teamSize, complexity, impact) and context.md
3. Check ONLY the relevant rule sets below based on D3 answer categories
4. Collect conflicts, adjust severity by context
5. If conflicts found → present grouped by severity (🔴 High → 🟡 Medium → 🟢 Low), ask for resolution
6. If clean or all resolved → write decision summary to manifest `decisions.design` (compact key-value pairs from Decisions Summary section) → proceed to generation

**Load validation rules from `{REFERENCES_DIR}/validation-rules-d3.md`** — read only the relevant sections based on D3 answer categories:
- **Foundation Consistency** → if `state.mode` = `incremental` AND `foundation` in `state.sharedPhases` (checks D3 answers against foundation decisions)
- **Technology Compatibility** → if D3 includes technology stack choices
- **Architecture & Performance** → if D3 includes architecture patterns or performance targets
- **Security** → if D3 includes security choices, PII/compliance, or frontend+backend combinations
- **Workflow & Cost** → if D3 includes repo strategy, CI/CD, observability, or cost-sensitive infrastructure

**Context-Based Severity Adjustments** (from workflow rules file):
- **Team Size**: Small (1–3) → complexity conflicts severity UP; Large (9+) → DOWN
- **Scope**: MVP → over-engineering severity UP; Enterprise → under-engineering severity UP
- **Timeline**: Urgent (<3mo) → complexity severity UP; Long-term (>6mo) → DOWN

**Conflict presentation**:
```
⚠️ Decision Validation — Conflicts Detected

## 🔴 Conflict 1: [Name] (High)
**Issue**: [Description]
**Your choices**: [Decision A]: [answer], [Decision B]: [answer]
**Options**: 1. [option] 2. [option] 3. Keep current (requires justification)
**Question**: How would you like to resolve this?
```

After resolution, append validation notes to the decisions file and proceed.

User can say "skip validation and proceed" → log in audit, add warning, proceed.

### Action: design-generation

#### Choose Format

- **Simple** (≤10 stories AND single domain) → compact `design.md` using `{ASSETS_DIR}/design-compact.md`
- **Complex** (11+ stories OR multiple domains) → modular `design.md` + `design/` folder

#### External Resources (Conditional)

If `{STEERING_DIR}/resources.md` exists and lists available resources (not "none"):
- **Design tool**: Use design tool MCP (if available) to read component inventory, design tokens → incorporate into design/components.md
- **API specs**: Read OpenAPI/GraphQL schemas → use as basis for design/api-spec.md instead of designing from scratch
- **Design system docs**: Read referenced docs → align component naming and patterns
- **Reference implementations**: Read referenced repos → align architecture patterns
- Cite external sources in design documents

#### Writing Strategy

1. Read all needed templates + input artifacts in one `readMultipleFiles` call
2. Write independent design detail files in parallel (same turn):
   - `design/components.md`, `design/data-model.md`, `design/api-spec.md` simultaneously
   - `design/integration.md`, `design/implementation.md` simultaneously
   - `design/nfr.md` (if applicable), `design/correctness.md` (if applicable)
3. **Checkpoint after each file write**: Update manifest `artifacts.design.files` to include the just-written file and set `artifacts.design.status` to `"partial"`. This enables context recovery to skip already-written files.
4. Write `design.md` last (it references the detail files — keep it slim: Summary + Architecture + Traceability + References only)
5. After all files written, update manifest status from `"partial"` to `"draft"`

#### No-Assumptions Rule

**CRITICAL**: ONLY use choices from D3. Read decisions from manifest `decisions.design` section. Fall back to reading `## Decisions Summary` from the decisions file if manifest section is missing. Do not parse the full question/answer blocks. Use `[TBD - not decided in D3]` for any missing decisions. Never assume technology choices that weren't explicitly decided.

#### Load Guides Conditionally

Load ONLY the guides that apply from `{REFERENCES_DIR}/`. Do NOT read guides that don't match.

| Guide | Load When |
|---|---|
| `architecture-patterns.md` | **ALWAYS** |
| `api-design.md` | D3 includes API design choices (REST/GraphQL/gRPC) |
| `frontend-architecture.md` | D3 includes frontend framework choice |
| `mobile-architecture.md` | D3 includes mobile platform choice |
| `distributed-patterns.md` | Architecture = microservices or distributed system |
| `property-based-testing.md` | D3 PBT answer = Yes |

**SKIP all non-matching guides.** For a simple backend API project, load only `architecture-patterns.md` and `api-design.md` (~8KB instead of ~25KB).

#### Templates

- Simple: `{ASSETS_DIR}/design-compact.md` ONLY
- Complex: `{ASSETS_DIR}/design.md` + modular templates:
  - `{ASSETS_DIR}/design-components.md`
  - `{ASSETS_DIR}/design-data-model.md`
  - `{ASSETS_DIR}/design-api-spec.md`
  - `{ASSETS_DIR}/design-integration.md`
  - `{ASSETS_DIR}/design-implementation.md`
  - `{ASSETS_DIR}/design-correctness.md` — ONLY if PBT selected
  - `{ASSETS_DIR}/nfr.md` — ONLY if NFR questions answered

#### Validate

- ✅ All components, entities, endpoints, integrations designed
- ✅ All D3 choices used, no assumptions beyond D3
- ✅ Design files reference each other correctly
- ✅ Cross-references between design files are correct

#### Update Steering

After generating design documents, update steering files with D3 decisions:

**`{STEERING_DIR}/tech.md`**: Replace "Pending D3 decisions" placeholders with actual choices:
- Stack (languages, frameworks, build system, testing, infrastructure)
- Architecture pattern and API style
- Infrastructure (cloud, compute, database, IaC)
- Conventions (code style, naming, testing pattern)

**`{STEERING_DIR}/structure.md`**: Replace "will be defined during design phase" placeholders with actual structure from `design/implementation.md`:
- Key Directories table from the directory structure
- Key Files table from project configuration
- Entry Points from the design

Read current steering files first, preserve existing content, update only the placeholder sections.

#### Update Manifest

Update artifacts in manifest:
- **Incremental mode**: Add `units[{unit}].artifacts.design` entry: `status: "draft"`, `timestamp`, `files` listing all generated design files. Write design decisions to `units[{unit}].decisions.design`.
- **Comprehensive mode**: Add top-level `artifacts.design` entry: `status: "draft"`, `timestamp`, `files`. Write design decisions to top-level `decisions.design`.
- Update `steering.updatedBy.tech` to include `design`
- Update `steering.updatedBy.structure` to include `design`
- Do NOT update phase state yet — wait for user approval

#### Present Results

```
📍 Design (4 of 6 phases)

[Summary]

- **Architecture**: [Style]
- **Stack**: [Frontend] / [Backend] / [Database] / [Infra]
- **Components**: [X] designed
- **Entities**: [Y] modeled
- **Endpoints**: [Z] specified
- **Integrations**: [W] defined
- **PBT Properties**: [N] (or "Skipped")
- **NFR**: [Included / Skipped]

Artifacts at `{SPECS_DIR}/{feature}/design.md` (+ `design/` folder if complex).

---
🔲 **Your turn**:
- ✅ "proceed" — move to next phase
- ✏️ "change [what]" — request edits
- ← "back to [requirements/decomposition/foundation]" — return to a previous phase (marks current design as draft)
```

**STOP and wait for approval.**

On "back to [phase]": Set current design artifact status to `"draft"`. Dispatch the named phase skill via orchestrator. The user will re-do that phase, and changes will cascade forward.

On approval: update manifest — **incremental mode**: set `units[{unit}].artifacts.design.status` to `"approved"`, set `units[{unit}].phase` to `"design"`, add `"design"` to `units[{unit}].completedPhases`. **Comprehensive mode**: set `artifacts.design.status` to `"approved"`, add `"design"` to `state.sharedPhases`. Append audit entry. If platform is Claude Code, update `CLAUDE.md` (set Phase to "design"). Then auto-continue (see Skill Handoff below).

### Action: design-edit

1. **Backup current artifacts**: Before overwriting, copy each file being modified to `{WORKFLOW_DIR}/{feature}/history/{filename}-{ISO-timestamp}.md`. Log the backup in the audit trail.
2. Read current `design.md` and relevant `design/*` files
2. Apply requested changes (modify components, update data model, change API endpoints, adjust integrations, etc.)
3. Maintain the No-Assumptions Rule — don't introduce choices not in D3
4. If change cascades (e.g., renaming an entity affects data-model, api-spec, and components), update ALL affected design files
5. Re-validate:
   - ✅ Cross-references between design files still correct
   - ✅ All D3 choices still reflected
   - ✅ No orphaned components or endpoints
   - ✅ No assumptions beyond D3 introduced
6. Mark downstream artifacts as `outdated` in manifest (tasks — if exists)
7. Present changes: files modified, summary, updated metrics
8. Include the `🔲 **Your turn**` prompt block and **STOP** — do not proceed until user approves

---

## Skill Handoff

When the user approves the design, auto-continue to the next skill:

1. Resolve: `{PLATFORM_DIR}/skills/aidlc-tasks/SKILL.md`
2. Read that file
3. Follow its instructions — begin the tasks phase in the same conversation

**Next skill mapping**:
- Design approved → `aidlc-tasks`

If the next skill's SKILL.md cannot be found, fall back to:
```
👉 Next: Activate the **aidlc-tasks** skill to break the design into implementation tasks.
```

---

## Behavioral Rules

### Rules
- Language: user's language for content, English for paths/code/tech terms. Silent on internal operations (manifest, audit, templates, validation, platform detection, guide loading).
- Tools — Kiro: `fsWrite`, `readMultipleFiles`. Claude Code: `Write`/`Edit`, parallel `Read`. Cursor/Windsurf: `Write`/`Edit`, sequential reads.
- Recovery: read `{STEERING_DIR}/aidlc-workflow.md` → manifest → SKILL.md → resume from current action.
- Errors: report clearly with what happened and what to do. Offer rebuild/retry. Never lose work silently.
- Optional file reads: If a file read fails, check whether the file exists. If it exists but can't be read, warn: "⚠️ File exists but could not be read: {path}". If it doesn't exist, skip silently (expected for optional inputs).

### Audit Trail
Append to `{WORKFLOW_DIR}/{feature}/audit.md` after: decision gate, validation, generation, approval, edit.

For incremental mode: write full entry to `{WORKFLOW_DIR}/{feature}/units/{unit}/audit.md` and a one-line summary to `{WORKFLOW_DIR}/{feature}/audit.md`.

Use the standard audit entry format:

```
### [{ISO timestamp}] {Phase}: {Action}

**Phase**: design
**Action**: {decision-gate | validation | generation | approval | edit}
**Artifacts**: {files created or modified}
**Outcome**: {result summary — e.g., "6 components, 4 entities, 12 endpoints, compact format, PBT included"}
```
