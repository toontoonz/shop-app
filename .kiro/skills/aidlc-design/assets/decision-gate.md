# Decision Gate Template

**Path**: `{WORKFLOW_DIR}/{feature}/decisions-*.md` (always `.aidlc/workflow/`)

Pure template structure for all decision files (D1, D2, D3, D4).

**Question Guidelines** (for the AI generating questions):
- Be specific and contextual — not "What database?" but "What database for user data and orders?"
- Offer 3-4 options with brief pros/cons, mark recommended, include "Other"
- One decision per question — ask about the system, not documentation
